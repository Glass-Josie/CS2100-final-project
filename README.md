Game of Battleship
Project Intro:
"Battleship is a classic two-person game, originating in pencil-paper form pre-dating World
War I. More recently, it was released as a game consisting of plastic grids and pegs, and
then an electronic version. Game play consists of a head to head battle between players.
Each player has a 10x10 grid of locations and a fleet of 5 ships. Before the game begins,
each player places their 5 ships on their board (hidden from the other player). Swapping
turns, the players guess a location on their opponent’s grid, in an attempt to locate a ship.
When a ship has been hit in all locations it spans, the ship is sunk. The first player to sink
their opponent’s entire fleet, wins the game."
For my implementation, the user will play against the computer. The computer will make
random (but not duplicate) guesses. The CellStatus, Ship, and Destroyer class were given by the professor, I wrote all other classes. The program reads text files to place the ships and then plays like normal, asking user for input each round until won or loss.
